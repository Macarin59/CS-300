**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

The goal of the course projects was to create an advising tool for ABCU to allow for course information to be access easier.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

I approached the problem by analyzing the efficiency of three data structures and then choosing the best one for the task at hand. Data structures are important to understand because they can vary drastically in efficiency.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

When writing the program, I was able to overcome all my roadblocks through extensive testing of each individual function, which made tracking down errors and points of failure significantly easier.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

My work on this project has helped me understand that there are many more data types out there to use and I access what would work best in the long run before choosing one.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

This project allowed me to practice writing modular, well documented code which will continue to improve the more I write.
